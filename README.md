### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first challenge I encounter was on the Deliverable 1, pivot table, I was not able to see the year under both the parent category and under the row labels, the problem was that I did not have the field “Date Created Conversion” under the row section. The second challenge was with the Deliverable 2, one of the formulas using COUNTIFS was bringing only $0.00 amounts, the problem was that I was missing a letter on one of the criteria.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The month of May is when there where the most successful campaigns 
2. The failed campaigns happened more during the months of May, June, July, August and October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful campaigns for “plays “where on the range of $0.00 to $5000.00 and there was not canceled outcomes for plays.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
