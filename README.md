### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first challenge I encounter was on the Deliverable 1, pivot table, I was not able to see the year under both the parent category and under the row labels, the problem was that I did not have the field “Date Created Conversion” under the row section. The second challenge was with the Deliverable 2, one of the formulas using COUNTIFS was bringing only $0.00 amounts, the problem was that I was missing a letter on one of the criteria.
